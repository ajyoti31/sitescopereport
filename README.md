We have 2 report, 1  is having monitor/object that is error state and 2nd report is having all object having features.
we desire to have object that are in error with its feature.
we did merge in-join for this 2 report and got report having monitor/object that are in error having features
I have used dictionary in python to generate new column/feature(port) from old column(parameter).
I have used google collab for this project
